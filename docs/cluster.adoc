= Configuring Redundant OpenLDAP

- Use a common global configuration
  ** Either store it in LDAP, or
  ** Distribute a static configuration: include slapd_repl.conf in slapd.conf
- The configuration includes the list of servers

    serverID  1 URI1
    serverID  2 URI2
    serverID  3 URI3

One of the URIs must exactly math the -h directive of the slaps startup command. This way the
daemon knows how to exclude itself form the repliaction.
